<To predict loan status>


Business Problem:
	Predict user is eligible for loan or not and also Predict how much loan the user can obtain based on Various Factos.

Objective : 
	The objective of analysis is to predict the customer Loan approval and Finding how much loan amount get by
Customer and do analysis by using Python libraries and eventually build a model to predict how much loan the user can 
obtain based on various factors with atmost Accuracy.  

Data Set Details:
	It is a Classification Problem which predicts if a loan will get approved or not and also predict loan amount.
Variable

Description

Loan_ID - Unique Loan ID

Gender - Male/ Female

Married- Applicant married (Y/N)

Dependents - Number of dependents

Education - Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)

Self_Employed - Self employed (Y/N)

ApplicantIncome - Applicant income

CoapplicantIncome - Coapplicant income

LoanAmount - Loan amount in thousands

Loan_Amount_Term - Term of loan in months

Credit_History - credit history meets guidelines

Property_Area - Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural

Loan_Status - Loan approved (Y/N)

It’s not at all easy to get a loan from the bank. Getting a loan approved requires a
complex mix of factors not the least of which is a steady income! So this ML project aims to create a model that will
classify how much loan the user can obtain based on various factors.
such as the user’s marital status, income, education, employment prospects, number of dependents, etc. 
The dataset attached provides details about all these factors which can then be used to create an ML model that
demonstrates the amount of loan that can be approved


Acceptance criteria:
1.	Prepare data for model training i.e. removing outliers , filling null values (both for categorical as well as numerical values) , removing skewness
2.	Find the variables which are co related and consider in building in your model and other feature engineering stuff if you can
3.	Pay attention to balanced and imbalanced data. Resample un balanced data
4.	Use your own understanding for identifying the algorithms that you need to use. How ever since its mostly a binary kind of classification problem use algos related to that
5.	Consider uni and multi variate Analysis to justify
6.	Use plot libraries to output the finding in each state
7.	You can use Jupyter or any other notebook for the same or develop with desktop IDEs like Visual Studio
8.	The project should be in working condition which is the most imp thing even if we don’t use all the considerations as described above.
